## Cheating on the video game 'warthunder' only using AI?
sadly AI is not able to fully code this from scratch as I still had to figure a good way of getting 'direction' estimation done and found the best and most cost-effective way in terms of processing time is by comparing similarity to images.
We use this to display a version of the vehicle with the crew, armament and armor as well as working parts transparent to allow us to see where the weakspots on the vehicles are that we can target. 


#this is a completely 'vibe-coded' test of if we can use ai to cheat on a videogame, theory and workflow made by me with a 80% AI 20% human split on the code.
The question I was trying to answer was can AI provide players a competitive advantage whilst being undetectable as it does not access memory or kernal level functions
the result 
-> result yes we can 
the vehicle is the T-90M that it is trained on
